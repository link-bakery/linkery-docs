### Hey bakers!👋

I'd like to introduce you to the idea behind **Linkery** (Link-Bakery).

{/* truncate */}

Linkery is a web application that allows users to create and manage custom links 
or redirects to their social media profiles, partner sites, or any other destinations. 
It's perfect for anyone who owns a domain and wants to take control of their personal or 
professional link management.

For example, let's say I own the domain `example.com` and I want to create redirects to my GitHub 
and YouTube pages. I can install Linkery on my own server, access its web-based admin panel, and 
set up redirects like `example.com/github` and `example.com/youtube`.

In the future, I plan to add support for link collections. With this feature, visitors to `example.com`
could see a list of available links and choose where they want to go — making Linkery even more versatile.

So, let's kick off this little-big project. Can't wait to see where it goes! See ya🚀🍩
